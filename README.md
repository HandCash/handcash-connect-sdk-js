## Install

`npm i @handcash/handcash-connect`

## Initialize the SDK

To start, you will need to create an instance of `HandCashConnect`. This object allows you to interact with the SDK.

> Don't have an app yet? Sign-up for [dashboard.handcash.dev](https://dashboard.handcash.dev) and create your first app.

A `HandCashConnect` requires a `appId` that represents your application, as well as an `appSecret` to ensure the SDK is invoked under your domain.

```typescript
import HandCashConnect from '@handcash/handcash-connect';

const handCashConnect = new HandCashConnect({
	appId: 'your-app-id',
	appSecret: 'your-app-secret',
});
```

## Accessing User Accounts

In order to access to user account and trigger payments on their behalf, you need to obtain an `authToken` that represents such permissions. You can find more about [the user authorization process](https://handcash.github.io/handcash-connect-sdk-js-beta-docs/#/user-authorization).

1. Get the `redirectionUrl` that redirects to HandCash to obtain the `authToken`
2. Redirect the user to the `redirectionUrl`.

```typescript
const redirectionUrl = handCashConnect.getRedirectionUrl();
```

3. Once the user is redirected back to your app with the authToken, you are ready to go!

```typescript
const account = handCashConnect.getAccountFromAuthToken(authToken);
```

## Your first payment

The following code shows how to make a simple payment:

```typescript
import HandCashConnect from '@handcash/handcash-connect';

const handCashConnect = new HandCashConnect({ appId: 'your-app-id', appSecret: 'your-app-secret' });
const account = handCashConnect.getAccountFromAuthToken(authToken);

const paymentParameters = {
	description: 'Hold my beer!üç∫',
	appAction: 'drink',
	payments: [
		{ to: 'eyeone', currencyCode: 'USD', amount: 0.25 },
		{ to: 'apagut', currencyCode: 'EUR', amount: 0.05 },
		{ to: 'satoshi', currencyCode: 'SAT', amount: 50000 },
	],
};

const paymentResult = await account.wallet.pay(paymentParameters);
console.log(paymentResult);
```
